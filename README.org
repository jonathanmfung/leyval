Investors can submit limit orders at any price...

The orders are stored and executed in the sequence that they are received by
the market. Transactions occur when a trader on the opposite side of the
market hits the quote. The limit orders for a specified quantity and price are
stored and executed using time priority at a given price and price priority
across prices.

“Market orders” in the Paris Bourse are not handled in the same way as in
the NYSE. They are executed against the best price on the opposite side of the
limit order book, but any excess that cannot be executed at that price is
converted into a limit order at that price rather than being executed at less
favorable prices by walking up (down) the book.
